# Kubernetes (K8S) Spot Instance Notification

This service will run as DaemonSet within your K8s cluster running on AWS Spot Instance, it watches the AWS metadata service when running on Spot Instances.

AWS Spot instance receives termination notice via the [instance meta data](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-ec2-spot-instance-termination-notices/), that field will become available when the instance has been marked for termination, and will contain the time when a shutdown signal will be sent to the instanceâ€™s operating system.

This service will notify you via Slack that an Spot instance will be taken out of service.
